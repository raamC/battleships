Generate battleships puzzles for fun.

Try and find all the ships, given the information on the ends of the rows and columns.

In main.js it is possible to configure the starting number and size of the ships, along with the size of the grid and the number of cells to reveal.

For this branch, I have ripped out rollup and all web stuff. This branch is for generating JSON files. These JSON files will be used to build and test a solver program.

To build this file

`cd src` then `node main`
